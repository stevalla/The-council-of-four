	* This is the main method that manages the Lobby, it is used to add a client
	* who join the server to the waiting GameController.
	* When a client join the server several operations occurred:\n
	* - a Token is associated with the client, in order to identify its request.<br>
	* - the Token created and the subscriber of the client are pass to the waiting GameController 
	*   that use {@link GameController#addPlayer(Token, SubscriberInt)} to handle the pub/sub 
	*   (hooking the client to the rights topics).<br>
	* - if there is at least one other client waiting in the same GameContorller
	* 	the {@link Timer} is cancel and a new {@link TimerTask} schedule.<br><br>
	* 
	* 
	* The Timer task take care about lanching a waiting GameController that has enough Player
	* to start. Firstly it sends a CommunicationResponse to all the clients that waitin it,
	* in order to forced the RMI clients that disconneted before the timer finished
	* to leave the waitingGameController (thus avoid a GameController to start with clients that have
	* been already exited from the game).
	* Then the runnable sleeping for 5oo ms to let all the RMI clients to disconnect correctly.
	* At the end the condition of beginning game is checked again, then (if true)
	* the waiting GameController is initialize by {@link GameController#initGame()} and the match starts.<br>
	* Waitnig GameController is stored in the list of running GameController and then
	* a new GameController is created to wait new request of connection.<br>
